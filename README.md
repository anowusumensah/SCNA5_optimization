patch clamp data of WT and Mutant channels that were studied by
Quentin et al.(DOI: 10.1016/j.cjco.2020.09.023)
Electrophysilogical dataset was fitted to Sodium Ionic model that
was developed by  Zheng at al.(doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0064286) which
could account for binoextial time constant after prolonged depolarization
